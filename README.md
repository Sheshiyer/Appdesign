## About Vibrasonix

Vibrasonix is a sound therapy application that combines binaural beats, PEMF technology, and vibroacoustic therapy through science-backed soundscapes to help users improve various aspects of their mental wellbeing:

- **Sleep enhancement** - Delta wave entrainment (0.5-4 Hz) for deep restorative sleep
- **Focus improvement** - Alpha and Gamma frequencies (8-12 Hz, 30-50 Hz) for enhanced cognition
- **Stress & anxiety reduction** - Reduce cortisol levels and increase endorphins
- **Meditation enhancement** - Theta frequencies (4-7 Hz) for hypnagogic states
- **Sound healing** - Vibroacoustic therapy across the 30-120 Hz therapeutic range
- **Spiritual exploration** - Access expanded states of consciousness

The app works in conjunction with the Vibrasonix-Cube device, which delivers therapeutic vibrations directly to the user's body through their bed.

## Audio Journeys

Vibrasonix offers a transformative audio experience through carefully curated journeys that combine sensory entrainment with vibroacoustic therapy. When coupled with Vibrasonix instruments, these journeys create a deep immersive experience through tactile sensory synchronization.

### Featured Albums

- **Wellness** - Promotes overall well-being through calming and rejuvenating experiences. Features curated journeys for stress relief, anxiety reduction, and mood enhancement.

- **Planet Tones** - Inspired by the symphony of the planets, these journeys align mind and body with universal rhythms. Uses planetary frequencies to induce meditation and stimulate creativity.

- **Sleep** - Designed for achieving deep, restful sleep through binaural beats and soothing soundscapes that reduce stress and promote relaxation.

- **Minerals** - Utilizes sonified frequencies of minerals (quartz, amethyst, gold) to stimulate natural healing, balance chakras, and enhance well-being.

- **Organs** - Helps attune organs to their natural harmony through specific frequency patterns that promote detoxification and improve overall health.

- **Chakras** - Balances and aligns the seven chakras using targeted sound frequencies, promoting physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.

- **Bioresonance** - Employs bio-resonant frequencies to stimulate the body's energy fields, supporting natural healing processes and detoxification.

- **Audio Genesis** - A collection of immersive soundscapes designed to transport listeners to new experiential dimensions.

### Technology

The music composition is crafted with precision to create sensory stimulation through:
- Binaural entrainment for direct brain and nervous system influence
- Isochronic tones for enhanced neural synchronization
- Bio-resonant frequencies for holistic healing
- Planetary frequency harmonics for cosmic alignment
- Mineral sonification for energetic balancing
