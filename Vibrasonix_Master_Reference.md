## Core App Concept

Vibrasonix is a sound therapy application that uses binaural beats and science-backed soundscapes to help users improve various aspects of their mental wellbeing:

- **Sleep enhancement**
- **Focus improvement**
- **Stress & anxiety reduction**
- **Meditation enhancement**
- **Sound healing**
- **Spiritual exploration**

The app positions sound as a powerful tool for mental state transformation, using the metaphor of a "drug without side effects" to create a compelling value proposition.

## App Personality

**Scientific yet accessible, mystical but credible, empowering not patronizing.**

The app balances scientific credibility with spiritual possibility, using direct, personal language that guides without condescension. Every visual and textual element should reinforce this personality.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Science-Backed Approach**: All sound experiences are grounded in research about frequency effects on brainwaves
2. **Personalized Journey**: User goals and preferences drive content recommendations
3. **Visual-Sonic Harmony**: Visual design elements reinforce and enhance the sonic experience
4. **Cosmic-Neural Aesthetic**: Unique visual identity merging cosmic elements with neural patterns

## Color System

- **Primary: Deep Blue (#1A1A2E)** - Base of UI, represents depth and possibility
- **Secondary: Teal Blue (#48AAAD)** - Interactive elements, highlighted text
- **Accent: Gold (#FFBD00)** - Logo, important accents, premium features
- **Text: White (#FFFFFF) and Light Gray (#E0E0E0)** - For optimal readability
- **Highlight: Teal Blue (#48AAAD)** - For important keywords in copy

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Onboarding Flow** (Screens 1-9)
   - Critical for user understanding and buy-in
   - Focus on smooth transitions and compelling visuals
   - Ensure copy clearly communicates value proposition

2. **Personalization** (Screens 8-12)
   - Goal selection and preference gathering
   - Dynamic content based on selections
   - Clear feedback on how selections impact experience

3. **Conversion Points** (Screens 13-14)
   - Account creation with minimal friction
   - Compelling subscription presentation
   - Clear free vs. premium value proposition

4. **Core Experience** (Screen 15)
   - Personalized content display
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Seamless playback experience

   - Measure time to complete onboarding
   - Identify any points of confusion or dropout

2. **A/B Testing Opportunities**
   - Test different versions of drug metaphor screen
   - Compare conversion rates with different subscription presentations
   - Test ordering of goal selection options

3. **Technical Testing**
   - Performance testing on various devices
   - Animation smoothness verification
   - Memory usage monitoring

## Asset Production Timeline
