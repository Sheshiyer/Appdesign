## About Vibrasonix

Vibrasonix is a sound therapy application that combines binaural beats, PEMF technology, and vibroacoustic therapy through science-backed soundscapes to help users improve various aspects of their mental wellbeing:

- **Sleep enhancement** - Delta wave entrainment (0.5-4 Hz) for deep restorative sleep
- **Focus improvement** - Alpha and Gamma frequencies (8-12 Hz, 30-50 Hz) for enhanced cognition
- **Stress & anxiety reduction** - Reduce cortisol levels and increase endorphins
- **Meditation enhancement** - Theta frequencies (4-7 Hz) for hypnagogic states
- **Sound healing** - Vibroacoustic therapy across the 30-120 Hz therapeutic range
- **Spiritual exploration** - Access expanded states of consciousness

The app works in conjunction with the Vibrasonix-Cube device, which delivers therapeutic vibrations directly to the user's body through their bed.
